## Optional Advanced Topics (4+ weeks, as time/interest allows)

- Real-time systems, embedded programming, cross-compilation

### Approach and Study Methodology

1. **Reading and Theory**:

    - Start each module by reading relevant sections of a trusted C textbook (e.g., _The C Programming Language_ by Kernighan and Ritchie, _Modern C_ by Jens Gustedt, or _C: A Reference Manual_ by Harbison and Steele).
    - Supplement theory with resources like the ISO C standard draft (for reference) and authoritative online documentation.
2. **Practical Exercises**:

    - Write small programs to reinforce each concept: from simple “Hello, World” to implementing a linked list or a basic file copy utility.
    - Gradually increase complexity by integrating multiple concepts in a single program.
3. **Tool Familiarization**:

    - Regularly use `gcc` or `clang` for compilation and `gdb` for debugging.
    - Experiment with compiler flags (`-Wall`, `-Wextra`, `-O2`, `-O3`, `-fsanitize=...`) to understand how they affect the build and runtime checks.
    - Explore `make` to automate builds, and later learn more complex build systems.
4. **Incremental Complexity**:

    - After mastering basic data structures, move to writing more complex programs that manipulate files, handle command-line arguments, and perform network I/O (optionally, after the main curriculum).
    - Integrate system calls and lower-level interfaces to get a feel for how C code interacts directly with OS services and hardware abstractions.
5. **Review and Iterate**:

    - At the end of each module, review the key lessons.
    - Make sure to quiz yourself: “How does the stack differ from the heap?”, “What does `static` at file scope mean?”, “How do I properly free memory allocated by `malloc`?”, etc.
