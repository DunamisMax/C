# C

Welcome to my **C** repository! This is the central hub for my journey into the C programming language, where I’m exploring everything from basic syntax and standard library usage to more advanced topics like systems programming, memory management, and optimization techniques.

This repo is designed as both a personal backup and a showcase of what I’ve learned, guided and assisted by GPT’s **o1-pro** mode. Each directory in this repository contains a self-contained C program or project that demonstrates new concepts, coding patterns, performance tricks, or simply solves interesting problems.

## Why This Repository?

1. **Personal Growth**:
   I’m using this repo to track my learning progress, experiment with new ideas, and reinforce best practices in C programming.

2. **Reference Material**:
   Each project is documented with explanations, comments, and notes to make it easier to revisit concepts later on. Over time, I expect this collection to serve as a reference to recall key patterns and implementations.

3. **Collaboration & Feedback**:
   I welcome input from other developers! If you see something that could be improved—whether it’s code style, performance, security, or compliance with standards—feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Project Structure

Each folder will focus on a distinct topic or project type. The general structure and common themes:

- **Project Directories**:
  Each directory is named descriptively (e.g., `hello-world`, `memory-management-experiments`, `data-structures`, `embedded-examples`). Inside each:
  - **Source Files (`.c`, `.h`)**: The heart of the code.
  - **Makefile or CMakeLists.txt** (if applicable): To streamline building the project.
  - **README.md** (when provided): Offering a detailed explanation of the project’s purpose, instructions on how to compile and run, and key learnings or takeaways.

- **Examples of Topics**:
  - **Basic Syntax & Idioms**: Simple programs to solidify my understanding of C fundamentals.
  - **Memory Management**: Experiments with `malloc`, `free`, pointers, allocation patterns, and careful handling of edge cases.
  - **Data Structures & Algorithms**: Implementations of linked lists, dynamic arrays, hash tables, trees, sorting & searching algorithms, and lock-free structures.
  - **Systems Programming**: Interacting with the OS, using system calls, exploring concurrency, signals, and process control.
  - **Embedded & Low-Level Programming**: Working close to hardware—accessing memory-mapped registers, handling interrupts, and ensuring reliable operation in constrained environments.
  - **Code Optimization & Tooling**: Performance tuning, profiling, and exploring compiler-specific optimizations, along with the use of `clang-tidy`, `valgrind`, and other tools.
  - **Testing & Security**: Test harnesses, fuzzing, and secure coding techniques that follow best practices and standards (C11, C17, C23).

## Getting Started

1. **Cloning the Repo**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dunamismax/c.git
   ```

2. **Navigating Projects**:
   Each project directory may have its own build instructions. Most simple programs can be compiled with:

   ```bash
   cd project-directory
   cc -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -std=c11 main.c -o project
   ./project
   ```

3. **Dependencies**:
   I aim to keep dependencies minimal. In some cases, I may rely on POSIX APIs. On Linux or macOS, the standard development tools should suffice. For more complex projects, details will appear in the project’s README.
